<h1>how to spot a phishing email</h1>

<p>phishing emails often create a sense of urgency to get you to act quickly without thinking. they might say things like "your account will be closed in 24 hours" or "immediate action required."</p>

<p>other common warning signs include generic greetings like "dear user," spelling and grammar mistakes, and suspicious-looking links. if you hover your mouse over a link and the web address looks strange or different from the real site, do not click it.</p>

<p>attachments are another big red flag. opening unexpected attachments can install malware on your device. always be cautious about any file sent by an unknown sender.</p>

<p>phishing scams often pretend to be well-known companies like amazon, netflix, or your bank. if an email seems odd, it is better to log in directly to the company's website instead of clicking any link in the email.</p>
