<h1>how to protect yourself from phishing attacks</h1>

<p>there are simple steps you can take to stay safe from phishing scams. always double-check who is sending you emails, and do not click on links or download attachments from people you do not recognize.</p>

<p>use multi-factor authentication whenever you can. it adds an extra layer of security even if your password gets stolen. keeping your devices updated with the latest security updates is also very important.</p>

<p>if you get a phishing email, report it to your email provider and delete it. never reply or click anything inside a suspicious message. if you think you fell for a scam, change your passwords right away and watch your accounts closely for strange activity.</p>

<p>staying informed, thinking before you click, and using strong security habits can make a huge difference in protecting your information online.</p>
